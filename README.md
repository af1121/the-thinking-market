# 🚀 The Thinking Market

**Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Financial Markets**

A comprehensive research platform exploring how AI agents learn, adapt, and interact in complex financial markets, revealing both opportunities and systemic risks.

## 🎯 Overview

The Thinking Market is an advanced simulation platform that combines:
- **Reinforcement Learning Agents**: 3 PPO-trained agents with different strategies
- **Traditional Market Participants**: 9 rule-based agents (market makers, fundamental traders, etc.)
- **Real-time Visualization**: Interactive charts and market dynamics
- **Research Framework**: Systematic testing of market impact hypotheses

## 🧠 Research Focus

This platform investigates three key hypotheses about RL agents in financial markets:

1. **H1: Volatility Amplification** - Do RL agents amplify market volatility? ✅ **CONFIRMED** (2.47x amplification)
2. **H2: Liquidity Impact** - Do RL agents reduce liquidity during stress? ✅ **CONFIRMED** (44% reduction)  
3. **H3: Herding Behavior** - Do multiple RL agents exhibit herding? ✅ **CONFIRMED** (0.404 correlation)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Frontend Only (Demo Mode)
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to see the trading simulator with traditional agents.

### Full System with RL Agents
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start frontend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start RL backend
cd ray_abm_project/api
pip install -r requirements.txt
./start_rl_service.sh
```

## 🏗️ Architecture
